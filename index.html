        <h3>Creative Writing</h3>

        Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the
        beginning
        of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces
        the
        writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as
        the
        first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a
        short
        story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No
        matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the
        paragraph
        into their writing.

        <h3>Tackle Writers' Block</h3>
        A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often
        happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a
        completely
        random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the
        writers'
        block in the first place.

        <h3> Beginning Writing Routine</h3>
        Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to generate a random
        paragraph
        with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just
        get
        the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing
        from
        their fingers.

        <h3> Writing Challenge</h3>
        Another writing challenge can be to take the individual sentences in the random paragraph and incorporate a
        single
        sentence from that into a new paragraph to create a short story. Unlike the random sentence generator, the
        sentences
        from the random paragraph will have some connection to one another so it will be a bit different. You also won't
        know exactly how many sentences will appear in the random paragraph.

        <h3> Programmers</h3>
        It's not only writers who can benefit from this free online tool. If you're a programmer who's working on a
        project
        where blocks of text are needed, this tool can be a great way to get that. It's a good way to test your
        programming
        and that the tool being created is working well.

        Above are a few examples of how the random paragraph generator can be beneficial. The best way to see if this
        random
        paragraph picker will be useful for your intended purposes is to give it a try. Generate a number of paragraphs
        to
        see if they are beneficial to your current project.

        If you do find this paragraph tool useful, please do us a favor and let us know how you're using it. It's
        greatly
        beneficial for us to know the different ways this tool is being used so we can improve it with updates. This is
        especially true since there are times when the generators we create get used in completely unanticipated ways
        from
        when we initially created them. If you have the time, please send us a quick note on what you'd like to see
        changed
        or added to make it better in the future.
